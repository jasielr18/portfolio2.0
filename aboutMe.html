        <pi >

I’m a self-driven web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After completing a year-long programming course at INFOTEP, I’ve been building real projects to sharpen my skills and transition into a professional role in tech.
</p>

<pi >
I have professional experience in customer service and team leadership, having worked as a Technical Support Agent at Teleperformance and currently as a Supervisor at Alorica. These roles have strengthened my communication skills, adaptability, and problem-solving—qualities I now apply to web development.
</p>

<pi >I’m fluent in English and comfortable working in bilingual environments. Currently, I’m focused on creating responsive websites and interactive web applications, and I’m actively looking for opportunities to grow as a front-end developer.</p>
